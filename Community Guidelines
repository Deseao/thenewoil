**The New Oil strives to create, host, and maintain a community where anyone from any background and experience level is welcome. Because this largely relies on the behavior of our members, this page will explain what is and isn't allowed in this community so that we can keep it safe and welcoming for everyone.**

## Community Behavior Guidelines

Ultimately most of our rules can be boiled down to “treat everyone equally and with respect. Remember there's a human on the other end of the screen.” Therefore we do not allow:

1. Any form of hate speech or discriminatory jokes (such as but not limited to sexism, racism, homophobia, etc).
2. Any "one-size-fits-all" or "gatekeeping" acting/thinking. This means acknowledging that everyone is in a different stage of their privacy journey with different resources; the tools you love may not fit their threat models, or they may not have reached your level yet. Be patient and understanding.
3. Any FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). This means not making claims that are false or untrue, including but not limited to unprovable, speculative, or conspiratorial claims. You are welcome to share these claims as opinions, but do not present them as proven facts unless backed up with hard evidence, that's properly checked and that comes from credible, respected sources.
4. “Doxxing.” We define doxxing as posting anyone else’s PII (personally identifiable information), including but not limited to names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, locations, photos, IP addresses, or anything else that they themselves have not intentionally disclosed. Any violation of this rule will result in an instant and permanent ban.
5. Conversations about religion, political belief, or any other “hot topics” that might reasonably upset people or cause heated, divisive discussions. These are important topics worth discussing, but this is not the place for them. We are a privacy/security community and we don’t want to alienate people just because we don’t share their political views.
6. NSFW ("Not Safe For Work") content, including but not limited to videos or images (real or illustrated) or discussions depicting sexual actions, gore, or violence (whether real or fictional).
7. The posting or use (such as profile pictures) of illegal emblems (e.g. Nazi symbols, etc) and/or supporting illegal causes/groups.
8. Inappropriate display names, usernames, or homeserver addresses (e.g. @address:homeserver) that violates any of the above rules. This will result in an instant and permanent ban.
9. Any form (or supporting) of internet trolling. This will result in an instant and permanent ban.

## Additional Guidelines

10. The main room is for on-topic discussions only; namely topics directly related to digital privacy and data security. For all other topics – including prolonged discussions, troubleshooting help, or polls - use the Off Topic room.
11. Keep all the discussions away from any unethical & illegal topics, such as but not limited to piracy. Remember that our rooms are hosted on "matrix.org's" homeserver (which is based in the United Kingdom) and that The New Oil is a United States based organization. We are subject to the laws of both of these jurisdictions.
12. Give context behind any links/media you post or when asked to do so. Links without context are a security risk.
13. Advertising without permission from a moderator or administrator isn't allowed. We are very open and friendly towards other projects, sites, and creators. If you ask us for permission, we’re very likely to approve it. Just be transparent.
14. Using bots, scripts, and "alts" without permission from a moderator and administrator isn't allowed. This is for the safety of our users. Likewise, using bots, scripts, and "alts" for unethical or illegal purposes is not allowed.

## _Note:_

- These community guidelines may change periodically without any notice (but we will do our best to inform users of updates).
 
- Community members are encouraged to “ping” moderators if someone is seen breaking rules and a moderator does not currently seem to be online or aware. (We are people, too. We may not be online at the moment when a rule breaker begins to act up.)
 
- Moderators may enforce the community guidelines as they see fit and shall also choose how many warnings they provide before they take action against any rule breaker(s).
 
- Moderators will use all legal methods at their disposal to enforce rules and bans.
 
- Moderators, administrators, public figures, etc from other communities are not in any way exempt from these community guidelines. Everyone will be treated equally no matter who they are, where they're from, what they do, etc.
