<h1 align="center">"Why Are Comments Disabled?"</h1>
</div>
<p>Hello internet stranger! If you're reading this, you almost certainly tried to comment on one of my YouTube videos and couldn't, and now you're here to find out why. I'll get straight to the point:</p>
<p><b>As a privacy advocate, I view privacy as a human right (like food and education) and Google is a major violator of this right.</b> I want to participate in Google's monopoly as little as possible. "Well why do you have a YouTube channel at all then?" you may ask. For the same reason that missionaries don't go to first-world churches and hospitals are full of sick people: the people that need my message most are the people who use YouTube, who aren't aware of privacy-respecting alternatives like PeerTube. I am on YouTube so that I can reach the people who need to hear my message most.</p>
<p>I disabled comments for several reasons. One, now people who view my videos can't give Google more of their data in the form of comments (where your cadence, wording, time, and other metadata can be gathered about you). I'm doing my part to forcibly reduce the Google data monopoly. Second, if someone happens across one of my videos and goes "man, I really want to comment, what gives?" now they're foced to come read this - here on my site - where they might start to learn why data privacy matters so much in the first place and why people like me (and the United Nations) consider it a human right. Finally, and related to reason #2: if somebody really feels compelled to publicly comment on one of my videos, they can do so by visiting me at one of my other more privacy-respecting video-publishing and commenting there.</p>
<p>"Well that's lame," you say. "I wanted to comment." And I want to hear from you! But I think your data matters more than you realize, and I'm trying to protect you as best I can. I understand if you feel like maybe I'm overstepping, and I apologize, but this is the best compromise I can find. <b>If you still want to contact me</b>, I offer a number of private ways on my <a href="links.html">Contact</a> page. If you think your comment deserves to be seen publicly, consider commenting on <a href="https://peertube.thenewoil.xyz/" target="_blank">PeerTube</a> or <a href="https://odysee.com/@thenewoil:f" target="_blank">Odysee</a>. The fact that you came here means that you really felt you had something meaningful to contribute to the conversation, and I really think you might. Please consider what I've said here today, and I hope you'll continue to view my content. Thank you so much for your time!</p>
