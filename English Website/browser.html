<h3>Why Should I Change my Browser?</h3>
</div>
<p>Currently <b>Google Chrome has the most users, but it's <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/21/google-chrome-has-become-surveillance-software-its-time-switch/">basically spyware</a></b>, even going so far as to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.hackread.com/google-chromium-browser-listens-conversations/">turn on your microphone and eavesdrop on you while you browse</a>. Instead, you can get almost identical performance and security with a massive improvement in privacy by switching to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a> or <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>. Changing browsers may take some getting used to at first, but is critical for improving your privacy.</p>
<div class="subheader" id="versus">
<h3>Brave vs Firefox</h3>
</div>
<p>Browsers are highly controversial. No matter what browsers I suggest, people will always say that I should've considered a different one or shouldn't have listed one I did. To see my criteria for why I selected these browers to list, check <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gitlab.com/thenewoil/website/-/wikis/Browser-Criteria">here</a>. In the interest of transparency, I do want to acknowledge that <b>both Brave and Mozilla have made questionable decisions</b>. Brave's criticisms mostly revolve around their use of BAT, a cryptocurrency they developed to allow site owners and content creators to get paid based on visits and time spent on their site. You can read more about that <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://brave.com/brave-rewards/">here</a>. Such decisions included <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/cryptocurrency-news/spotlight/famous-youtuber-tom-scott-frustrated-with-brave/">collecting payments on behalf of a creator who claims he never got paid</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-privacy/brave-privacy-browser-caught-automatically-adding-affiliate-links-to-cryptocurrency-urls/">injecting affiliate links into browser traffic so Brave made more money</a>. These situations have since been corrected. For Mozilla's shortcomings, they regularly draw criticism for making their analytics opt-out rather than opt-in, making Google the default search engine, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/endangered-firefox-the-state-of-mozilla/">paying their CEO over $3 million USD per year while struggling to be financially solvent</a>. I also want readers to be aware that Firefox has <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ghacks.net/2022/03/17/each-firefox-download-has-a-unique-identifier/">been found</a> to be issuing a temporary, one-time tracker that shares some data with Google when you download and install the program for the first time on Windows or Mac, so if you go this route I suggest you turn off your internet during the installation until you have a chance to disable analytics (discussed below).<p>
</p>While I don't think there is a perfect solution in this space, I personally recommend Brave. It is the most Chrome-like so most users will find the transition easy, using the Chromium engine will make you "blend in" more with other chrome users, and frankly Brave is constantly rolling out new default anti-fingerprinting features that - in my opinion - are leaving Firefox in the dust. Having said that, a lot of peope feel very strongly about Brave as a company, the BAT token, and the idea of giving Google too much power by having too many users dependent on the Chromium engine. Therefore, I will leave it up to my readers to decide which company they consider to be more ethical and which browser is right for their needs. If you still find yourself on the fence, it's worth noting that Chromium-based browsers tend to have better security, however as long as you're using good <a href="habits.html">online habits</a> the difference should be minimal for most casual web users (<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/firefox-chromium.html">Source</a>).</p>
<div class="subheader" id="plugins">
<h3>Plugins</h3>
</div>
<img src="pictures/ublock.png" alt="ublock origin logo" align="left" style="padding:5px;">
<p><b>Regardless of which browser you decide to go with, there is one plugin you should add to dramatically improve your privacy and security.</b> This is <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a>, a powerful, lightweight ad- and tracker-blocker. Once installed, open the plugin and open the <a href="pictures/ublock1.jpg">settings</a>. Be sure to enable every option under the "<a href="pictures/ublock2.jpg">Privacy</a>" section. Now click on the tab “<a href="pictures/ublock3.jpg">Filter lists</a>” and enable everything under “Built-In,” “Ads,” "Privacy," “Malware domains,” “Annoyances,” and "Multipurpose." I would also recommend checking the "Regions, languages" section if you live outside North America and enable for your location, too. In my experience, enabling all the features has never presented any significant site breakage. However, if you find yourself repeatedly running into issues with a lot of sites not working correctly, the developer's recommended list of plugins are all of the "Built-In" plugins, "EasyList" under "Ads," "EasyPrivacy" under "Privacy," "Online Malicious URL Blocklist" under "Malware domains," and "Peter Lowe's Ad and tracking server list" under "Multipurpose." This should provide a minimum level of protection without site breakages.</p>
<img src="pictures/localcdn.png" align="right" alt="localcdcn logo" style="padding:5px;">
<p>The other plugin, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.localcdn.org/">LocalCDN</a>, is only recommend if you don't plan to use a <a href="vpns.html">VPN</a>). LocalCDN is a plugin that will replace a lot of third-party libraries like JQuery, Google, and Bootstrap and inject them locally from privacy-respecting alternate sources. These third-party libraries and CDNs can be used to track you, so this plugin helps to reduce tracking. If all that went over your head, just know that this blocks a large number of trackers without any configuration or interaction required on your end. Just install it and let it run. Again, you do not need this plugin if you're using a VPN. Brave (and Firefox with the Enhanced Tracking Protection settings I recommend in the next section) will do an excellent job of isolating third-party libraries to reduce or prevent tracking, and the VPN will prevent the trackers from seeing your IP address, making LocalCDN largely redundant..</p>
<p>In my experience, these plugins and settings rarely cause any issues, but be aware that in extreme cases they can break sites and must be temporarily turned off if site access is required.</p>
<div class="subheader" id="settings">
<h3>Settings</h3>
</div>
<img src="pictures/brave.png" align="left" style="padding:5px;" alt="brave logo">
<p><b>If you are using Brave</b>, disable all the options under "Social Media Blocking" and change your default Search Engine to a <a href="habits.html">privacy respecting alternative</a> (you can add a custom search engine by navigating to that site then checking your settings while still there). Next navigate to "Privacy and Security," then "Cookies and other site data," and set Brave to "Clear cookies and site data when you close all windows." (See my notes on this below before committing to this.) Back out of the "Cookies and other site data" menu then go to the "Security" menu, enable "Use secure DNS" and select "With: Quad9 (or NextDNS)" from the dropdown menu (note: don't enable this if you plan to use a <a href="vpns.html">VPN</a> as it may cause DNS leakages and affect privacy and functionality).</p>
<img src="pictures/firefox.png" align="right" style="padding:5px;" alt="firefox logo">
<p><b>If you are using Firefox</b>, I recommend you turn off your internet before installation if you haven't already. Mozilla <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ghacks.net/2022/03/17/each-firefox-download-has-a-unique-identifier/">issues</a> a temporary, one-time tracker that utilizes Google Analytics to understand the relationship between downloads and installations. This will be disabled in the settings I discuss in the next paragraph, but until we get a chance to do that the only way to stop that data leak is to turn off your internet. (This applies only to Mac and Windows, not Linux users who compile or use the repositories.) Once installed, go to your settings and start in the first tab, “General.” Under "Files and Applications," you'll want to check "Always ask you where to save files." This is a security improvement to ensure that nothing downloads without you noticing. Next, scroll down to "Firefox Updates." I recommend allowing Firefox to automatically install updates to ensure you're always using the msot recent version. Finally, scroll all the way to the bottom where it says “Network Settings.” Open this by clicking the gray “Settings” button, scroll to the bottom, and change "Cloudlfare" to "NextDNS" (note: don't enable this if you plan to use a <a href="vpns.html">VPN</a> as it may cause DNS leakages and affect privacy and functionality). Click “Okay” then go to the "Search" tab. Under "Default Search Engine," select a <a href="habits.html">privacy respecting search engine</a>. Finally, visit the “Privacy & Security” tab. The first section is “Enhanced Tracking Protection.” Click the second option, “Strict.” I have never seen this cause any site breakage before, but if it does you can set it back to "Standard." Next scroll down to "Cookies and Site Data" and click "Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed" (see my notes on this below before committing to this). Next scroll down to "Address Bar" and disable "Contextual suggestions." Last but not least, scroll to the bottom, under "HTTPS-Only Mode" and click "Enable HTTPS-Only Mode in all windows."</p>
<p><b>Both Brave and Firefox</b> have some usage-reporting settings that are enabled by default. These statistics are reported to Brave/Mozilla for the purpose of improving the browser. However, if you are uncomfortable submitting that data you can disable it. For Brave, go to "Additional settings" -> "Privacy and security" and uncheck "Automatically send completely private product analytics to Brave". For Firefox, uncheck all four boxes located under "Privacy & Security" -> "Firefox Data Collection and Use."</p>
<p>It should also be noted that these are minimum suggestions. You are, of course, welcome to go above and beyond by doing things like not saving history and disabling autofill, and using a different <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://privacyguides.org/providers/dns/">DNS-over-HTTPS</a> resolver of your choice.</p>
<div class="subheader" id="cookies">
<h3>Clearing Cookies</h3>
</div>
<p>I strongly recommend that you set your browser to clear data on exit, particularly cookies. This means that the browser will not remember you when you click "stay logged in" or "remember this device" or other similar boxes at login. You will have to log in every time you open the browser, including using your <a href="mfa.html">2FA code</a>. The reason I believe this to be a worthwhile inconvenience is because there has been a rise in malware that will steal your <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://eclypses.com/news/cyber-criminals-defeating-2fa-security/">authentication cookies</a> right out of the browser, allowing an attacker to completely bypass both the username/<a href="passwords.html">password</a> and the two-factor authentication as if they were already logged in. Not saving cookies won't protect you against this malware stealing from accounts you access while infected (if infected), but they will prevent an attacker from being able to scoop up every account you've ever saved in your browser and that will reduce the damage until the infection can be found and removed.</p>
<div class="subheader" id="tor">
<h3>Honorable Mention: Tor Browser</h3>
</div>
<img src="pictures/tor.png" align="left" style="padding:5px;" class="invert">
<p>Between the plugins and the settings changes suggested on this page, you will greatly reduce the ability of websites to track you as you go from site to site. However, it should be noted that browser fingerprinting - one of the most common forms of online tracking - is incredibly complex and ever evolving. While these changes have dramatically reduced your fingerprint, you should not assume - as with any of the advice I give on this site - that you are totally invisible or untrackable. If you want to achieve maximum privacy and/or anonymity, consider using the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">Tor Browser</a>.</p>
<p>The Tor browser is a somewhat common daily browser among privacy enthusiasts for a few reasons. If you're unfamiliar with Tor, check out my <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://peertube.thenewoil.xyz/videos/watch/c6f44348-3599-443d-8b92-f11dcdf10fc9">Tor Crash Course</a> video. The Tor browser routes only your browser traffic through the Tor network and not all device traffic. The Tor browser also comes pre-packaged with a more advanced content blocker called No-Script which can be used to block ads, as well as a ton of unseen, powerful tracker-blocking features. The Tor browser also isolates each tab and changes your relay path with every new website you visit to help further protect your anonymity. <b>Using the Tor Browser as your main browser is a great idea</b>, but keep in mind that many legitimate websites such as banking and e-commerce sites block known Tor addresses to prevent abuse and fraud, so <b>you'll want to keep a copy of Brave/Firefox installed</b> for when that happens. Additionally, using the Tor Browser in a truly, 100% anonymous way is incredibly difficult and requires very intentional browsing habits, so don't do anything illegal. Finally, because all nodes are volunteer-run and therefore work on an "honor system," be sure to check that any site you login or transfer personal data across is using HTTPS (the lock icon at the beginning of the address bar) and is the actual site and not a fake phishing site designed to look like the real thing.</p>
<p>If you're still unsure what browser is right for you, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://privacytests.org/">Privacy Tests</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.cookiestatus.com/">Cookie Status</a> compare a few of the more popular choices.</p>
