<h1 align="center">Privacy Policy</h1>
<h3 align="center">Creation Date: M10/D17/Y21 (October 17, 2021)</h3>
<h3 align="center">Modification Date: M12/D05/Y21 (December 5, 2021)</h3>

<p>This privacy policy will explain what information is collected when you access and make use of this website. This privacy policy will explain the following: the uses of the information, the way we secure and protect such information, who has access to this information, the location where this information is kept, and when the information is collected. You can view Namecheap's official privacy policy <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/legal/general/privacy-policy/">here</a>. This policy attempts to be more comprehensive and simplified than Namecheap's official privacy policy.</p>
<p><b>What data is collected and why</b></p>
<p><i>What data is collected:</i>
<li>The IP address (Internet Protocol address) of the user/visitor.
<li>The geolocation of the user/visitor.
<li>The visit duration of how long the user/visitor has stay on the website.
<li>The OS (operating system) of the user/visitor.
<li>The browser of the user/visitor.
<li>The referrer URL (the website the user came from) of the user/visitor.
</ul></p>
<p>(According to the hosting provider (Namecheap, Inc.) this data is only stored for 24 hours)</p>
<p><i>The data stated above is used and collected for the following purposes:</i></p>
<li>Understanding how visitors access the site to better optimise the website and services of the hosting provider.
<li>Understanding how the site is performing (if we are seeing more or less visitors on average).
<li>Diagnose and debug technical problems and errors.
<li>Defending & protecting the website and services of the hosting provider from abuse.
</ul></p>
<p><b>When is your data collected and shared</b></p>
<p><i>When we collect your data:</i></p>
<p>The website administrator likes to adhere to a “the less we know the better” policy, meaning that we try to collect as little user/visitor information as possible. When you access this website, the hosting provider (Namecheap, Inc) will collect the data listed above. The New Oil does not have control over this collection process, and therefore cannot reduce or expand it. The New Oil highly encourages you to visit with a VPN or Tor browser to avoid this data collection. The data collected by the hosting provider is - to our knowledge - limited to your access and use of this website and does not use any tracking technologies such as cookies or beacons to track or identify your or your activity on other websites.</p>
<p><i>Who has access to your data:</i></p>
<p>Namecheap, Inc has access to all this data as this data is forcibly collected by the company and the company is not zero-knowledge.</p>
<p>The New Oil does have access to the information listed above, but typically is only interested in the number of unique visits. No member of The New Oil ever copies, screenshots, or in any other way records this data except in the annual transparency report (see "When is your data shared" below).</p>
<p><i>When is your data shared:</i></p>
<p>The administrator does not ever share data except total unique visitors each year as part of The New Oil's annual transparency report. The administrator is US-based, however, and will comply with any legally-binding orders from law enforcement or government agency for user data. However, given that the hosting provider collects this same data, law enforcement agencies are much more likely to approach the hosting provider rather than the website administrator.</p>
<p><b>Where is your data stored and how do we protect it</b></p>
<p><i>Where is your data stored:</i></p>
<p>Your data is stored with Namecheap, Inc which is based in the United States, but has data centres in the USA, EU, UK. We do not control those data centres and therefore we do not have control over the security of your data. The specific locations of those data centres are as follows.
<ul>
<li>The European data centre is based in the Netherlands, Amsterdam.
<li>The United Kingdom data centre is located in a data centre controlled by Timico Ltd close to Nottingham, in the Midlands.
<li>The United States data centre is controlled by Phoenix NAP, LLC and is located in Phoenix, Arizona, USA.
</ul></p>
<p><i>How do we protect your data:</i></p>
<p>As stated in the text above, “we do not control those data centres and there for do not have control over the security of your data“. However, The New Oil attemps to help protact the information of its users/visitors as best as possible. The website administrator and The New Oil's team members & core contributors use all available security features - such as strong, unique passwords and multifactor authentication - to protact their accounts from unauthorized access and their permissions from being misused in any way possible. All other services are also hardened in accordance with recommendations from our technical adviser and relevant, trusted authorities including government bodies and policymakers.</p>
