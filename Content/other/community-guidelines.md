# Community Guidelines

The New Oil (TNO for short) strives to create, host, and maintain a community where anyone from any background and experience level is welcome. This page will explain what is and isn't allowed in this community, so that we can keep this community safe and welcoming for everyone.

- Treat everyone equally and with respect. Remember there's a human on the other end of the screen.

- Any form of hate speech or discriminatory jokes (such as but not limited to sexism, racism, homophobia, etc) is not allowed.

- Create an environment where people arenâ€™t afraid to talk and ask questions. Be "beginner-friendly".

- No "one-size-fits-all" or "gatekeeping" acting/thinking. This means not making claims that are false or untrue, including but not limited to unprovable, speculative, or conspiratorial claims. You are welcome to share these claims as opinions, but do not present them as proven facts unless backed up with hard evidence, that's properly checked and that comes from a multitude of credible and respected sources.

- Don't talk about religion, political belief, sexual orientations, or any other stuff that otherwise may upset people without the permission from a moderator or administrator.

- Do not post or discuss anything NSFW ("No Safe For Work") related (meaning, videos or images depicting sexual actions, gore, or violence whether real or illustrated, verbal descriptions, and any other discussions related to these topics).

- Give context behind any links/media you post or when asked to do so.

- Main room is on topic only. This means no off-topic discussions in the main room (e.g. any support related questions, unnecessary debates, and or news articles, etc).

- Keep all the discussions legal and away from any unethical & non legal stuff, you get the drill. Remember that our rooms are hosted on "matrix.org's" homeserver and that it's based in the United Kingdom and also note that "The New Oil" is a United States based organization, so laws of both of these jurisdictions may apply.

- Do not post any else's PII (personally identifiable information). This includes any information that could be used to track people down, this information may include the following: name(s), address(s), phone number(s), email(s), geographical location(s), photo(s), IP address(s), or anything else that they themselves have not disclosed. It's also recommend that user's should be very cautious when disclosing any of their (your) own PII.

- [this rule is an extension of the PII guideline] Any form of doxing (aka dox -- dropping the dox) shall be considered breaking the community guidelines and will result in an instant suspension of your membership to all of The New Oil's communities (This means that we have a strict no doxing policy).

- Advertising without permission from a moderator or administrator ins't allowed.

- Using "bots", scripts, and "alts" without permission from a moderator and administrator isn't allowed.

- Using "bots", scripts, and "alts" in a "bad" or illegal way isn't allowed.

- Using illegal emblems (e.g. Nazi symbols, etc) and supporting illegal causes/theorist group ins't allowed.

- Doing any form (or supporting) of internet trolling will result in an instant suspension of your membership to all of The New Oil's communities.
