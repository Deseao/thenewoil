 # Community Guidelines

**The New Oil strives to create, host, and maintain a community where anyone from any background and experience level is welcome. Because this largely relies on the behavior of our members, this page will explain what is and isn't allowed in this community so that we can keep it safe and welcoming for everyone.**

## Behavioral Guidelines (What's Not Allowed)

Ultimately most of our rules can be boiled down to “treat everyone equally and with respect. Remember there's a human on the other end of the screen.”

1. Any form of hate speech or discriminatory jokes (such as but not limited to sexism, racism, homophobia, etc) is not allowed.

2. Any "one-size-fits-all" or "gatekeeping" acting/thinking. This means acknowledging that everyone is in a different stage of their privacy journey with different resources is not allowed.

3. Any FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) is not allowed. This means that making claims that are false or untrue, including but not limited to unprovable, speculative, or conspiratorial claims is not allowed.

4. "Doxxing" is not allowed. We define doxxing as posting anyone else's PII (personally identifiable information). This includes any information that could be used to track people down, such as (but not limited to) name(s), address(s), phone number(s), email(s), geographical location(s), photo(s), IP address(s), or anything else that they themselves have not disclosed.

5. Conversations about about religion, political belief, or any other "hot topics" that might reasonably upset people or cause heated, divisive discussions are not allowed. These are important issues worth discussing, but this is not the place for them.

6. NSFW ("No Safe For Work") content, including but not limited to videos or images (real or illustrated) or discussions depicting sexual actions, gore, or violence (real or fictional) is not allowed.

7. The posting or use (such as profile pictures) of illegal or unethical emblems (e.g. Nazi symbols, rebel flags, etc) and/or supporting illegal causes/groups is not allowed.

8. Inappropriate display names, usernames, or matrix homeserver addresses (e.g. @address:homeserver) that violates any of our guidelines are not allowed.

9. Any form (or supporting) of internet trolling is not allowed.

10. Advertising in any form is not allowed.

11. The Main room is for on-topic discussions only - namely topics directly related to digital privacy and cybersecurity. For all other discussions please refer to the Off Topic room.

12. Keep all discussions legal and ethical. Remember that our rooms are hosted on matrix.org's homeserver (which is based in the United Kingdom) and that The New Oil is based in the United States. We are subject to the laws of both of these jurisdictions.

13. Give context behind any links/media you post or when asked to do so.

14. Using bots, scripts, and "alts" without permission from a moderator isn't allowed. This is for the integrity and safety of the room.

15. Using bots, scripts, and "alts" for unethical or illegal purposes is not allowed.

## _Note:_

These community guidelines may change periodically without any notice (but we will do our best to inform users of updates).

Community members are encouraged to "ping" (@ mention) moderators if someone is seen breaking rules and a moderator currently seems to be offline or unaware.

Moderators reserve the right to enforce the community guidelines to the extent they see fit, up to and including immediate and permanent bans.

Moderators reserve the right to enforce bans or suspensions by any legal means they see fit.

Moderators reserver the right to choose how many warnings they provide before taking action against any rule breaker(s).

Moderators, administrators, public figures, etc from other communities are not in any way exempt from these community guidelines. Everyone will be treated equally, not matter who they are, where they're from, or what they do, etc.
