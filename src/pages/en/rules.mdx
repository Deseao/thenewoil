# Community Guidelines

The New Oil strives to create, host, and maintain a community where anyone from any background and experience level is welcome. To that end, we enforce the following rules:

1. **Treat everyone equally and with respect.** Remember there's a human on the other end of the screen.

2. **No form of hate speech or discrimination is allowed.** This includes but is not limited to sexism, racism, homophobia, and transphobia. This also includes usernames and profile pictures, as well as expressing support for hate groups.

3. **No "one-size-fits-all" or "gatekeeping" acting/thinking.** Remember that everyone has a different threat model, skill level, and priorities. Remember The New Oil's target audience.

4. **No "FUD" (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), aka "conspiracy theories."** This includes making claims that are provably false or speculative. You are welcome to share speculative claims as clearly-marked personal opinions, but do not present them as proven facts.

5. **No "ad hominem" attacks.** For example, you are allowed to dislike another figure in the privacy/security community, but please explain why you take issue with their stances. This is to ensure that such discussions remain productive and that the community does not devolve into a toxic pool of slander and "talking behind someone's back."

6. **No discussions about religion, political belief, sexual orientations, or any other "hot button" issues.** These are important discussions, but this is not the place for them.

7. **No "drama."** This is loosely defined as talking poorly about another community or figure in the privacy/security community without a productive goal in mind. We acknowledge that this rule will be very context-sensitive, and we do not wish to censor anyone's freedom of speech, however we do not want our community to become a cesspit of slander and "talking behind someone's back," nor a home for FUD about other figures/communities, therefore this rule will be identified and dealt with on a case-by-case basis. This includes but is not limited to things such as criticizing another community because you were banned there or intentionally bringing up existing feuds with the sole purpose to stir up "drama." (This explicitly and specifically includes the dispute between Graphene OS and Techlore regardless of context or intention.)

8. **No NSFW ("No Safe For Work") material**, including but not limited to videos, images, or text depicting sexual actions, gore, or violence whether real or fictional.

9. **No illegal discussions or recommendations.** "Illegal" in this context is defined by American and UK laws (as The New Oil is an American entity, and the matrix.org homeserver we use is hosted in the UK).

10. **No doxing.** This is defined as posting any information about a person that they have not shared themselves, including but not limited to names, locations, IP addresses, photos, etc.

11. **No repeated advertising.** Sharing or promoting your project or product - if it's related - is okay once in a while, but we are not your advertising platform so don't overdo it.

12. **It is considered good etiquette to describe any links you share, no matter how obvious the link may seem.**

13. **The "Main" room is for discussions including (but not limited to) talk about digital privacy and cybersecurity, sharing relevant news articles, and discussing different strategies or light tech support.** Jokes, tangents, and casual discussions should be moved to the "Off Topic" room.

14. **We are not a tech support community.** While we do welcome some discussion about configurations, settings, or troubleshooting, your advanced, specific, or difficult problems should be directed to the companies, communities, or people who support the service you're having issues with.

15. **Do not feed the trolls.** This means no engaging, no taunting, no insulting, no commenting about spam attacks, etc. Carry on as normal, the mods will work as quickly as we can to handle the situation. The only deviation from your normal routine should be to tag a mod.

**For the NSFW room only**

16. **The "No NSFW" rule is suspended. However, please note that this room is NOT a porn room.** It is not here to post porn, trade material, get recommendations, or meet people. This room is purely for discussions that happen to be about both data privacy/cybersecurity and adult topics. These topics could include adult modeling, safely accessing adult material, or even "uncomfortable" topics like death planning or escaping domestic violence situations.

17. **Be 18+ (or whatever the legal age of adulthood is in your jurisdiction).**

18. **The NSFW room is a judgement free zone, within reason.**
