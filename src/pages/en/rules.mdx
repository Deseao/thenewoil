# Community Guidelines

The New Oil strives to create, host, and maintain communities where anyone from any background and experience level is welcome. To that end, we enforce the following rules:

2. **No "one-size-fits-all" or "gatekeeping" acting/thinking.** Remember that everyone has a different threat model, skill level, and priorities. Remember The New Oil's target audience.

3. **No "FUD" (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), aka "conspiracy theories."** This includes making claims that are provably false or speculative. You are welcome to share speculative claims as clearly-marked personal opinions, but do not present them as proven facts.

_These community guidelines may change without warning. We will do our best to announce noteworthy changes, but we are not responsible for members missing said updates._
