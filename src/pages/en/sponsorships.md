# Sponsorship Criteria

This policy will explain what The New Oil expects from its current and future sponsors for the sake of transparency and for the benefit of prospective sponsors. Sponsors may sponsor videos and/or blog posts. We do not accept sponspored content for the website or news feed at this time.

* Sponsors are not required to strictly meet the same criteria as other listings on the website. However, they are still expected to demonstrate alignment with The New Oil's mission and values: accessible, genuine privacy and cybersecurity for individual users. Sponsors are expected to reasonably demonstrate that their services and products are in keeping with The New Oil's [Mission Statement](/about#mission-statement).
* All sponsors will be vetted, investigated, and may be subject to additional questions or verification to ensure they comply with The New Oil's mission, target audience, and values.
* If a sponsor takes issue with an opinion, we will happily refund them and end the sponsorship agreement.
* If a sponsor takes issue with something we said because it is factually incorrect, they may reach out to us with corrected information and we will happily issue a public correction. We reserve the right to ask them more questions and ask for evidence of their claims.
* All potential conflicts of interest must be disclosed by The New Oil up front at the appropriate place and time (e.g. a review of VPN service would say at the beginning "this VPN service is one of our sponsors").
* Sponsors may not sponsor a review, blog post, video, or any other content about the same topic for which they provide a service or product (e.g. a VPN service cannot sponsor a blog post about VPNs, even if it's a review of a different provider or a post about VPNs in general).
* Sponsors may provide a script advertising the product or service, or may request specific features be highlighted and discussed. Otherwise, The New Oil will create our own such script. In either case, promotional will time will not exceed 2 minutes for videos and 1 paragraph for blog posts.
* Video/Blog sponsors may not request that their ad be placed at or in a specific time period or selection of a video/blog post. All sponsored content will be at the start of the blog/video (no later than just after the introduction) and at the end just before the outro (videos only).
