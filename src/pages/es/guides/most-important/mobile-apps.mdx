# Securing Mobile: Replacement Apps

See my criteria for this page [here](https://gitlab.com/thenewoil/website/-/wikis/Mobile-&-Destkop-Settings-and-Apps-Criteria).

<Criterias data={data} direction="col" />

I encourage you to remove any unused or infrequenly-used apps from your phone. Mobile apps are both invasive for privacy and a potential way entry point for malware and attackers so the fewer you have, the better. Additionally, **if your phone is lost or stolen, having sensitive apps like work email and banking can allow further abuse.**
