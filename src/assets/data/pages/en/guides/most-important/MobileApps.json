          "**Note:** You cannot use a VPN and Firewall/Content Blocker at the same time*. I recommend using a reputable [VPN provider](/guides/less-important/vpns) who offers their own DNS resolver that blocks known trackers, ads, and malware. You may also use a custom DNS resolver that also blocks ads and/or trackers instead of a VPN, but your traffic will remain exposed to varying degrees so I don't recommend this. See [this article](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/03/26/make-android-use-dns-server-choice/) for instructions on how to change the DNS on Android, and [this article](https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/features/how-to-change-dns-server-on-iphone-ipad-or-ipod-touch-1671813) for instructions on how to change the DNS on iOS. See [Privacy Guides](https://privacyguides.org/providers/dns/) for a list of recommended DNS resolvers if you are unsure which one to use.",

The risks of DNS leakage vary based on your [threat model](/guides/prologue/threatmodel), but I recommend using a VPN without a Firewall/content Blocker just to err on the side of caution."
