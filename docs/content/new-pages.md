# Creating a new page

Under the `pages` folder, create a `.mdx` or `.md` file. `.md` and `.mdx` pages will include frontmatter. An example would be:

```yaml
---
layout: "@layouts/guides.astro"
title: Understanding Surveillance
draft: false
---
```

Any content after can be written in markdown or HTML format.

See <https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-pages/> for more information.
